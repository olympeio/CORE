/**
## Description
Sends an HTTP PATCH request to the specified URL and provide the results.

The HTTP PATCH request method applies partial modifications to a resource.
The HTTP PUT method only allows complete replacement of a document. Unlike PUT, PATCH is not idempotent, meaning
successive identical patch requests may have different effects. However, it is possible to issue PATCH requests in
such a way as to be idempotent.

Additional headers can be provided and returned in a string that has to be in JSON format.

**Example:** '{"Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8",  "Content-Length": 1024 }'

## Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| URL | String | The URL to query. |
| Headers | String | Optional HTTP headers in a JSON parsable string. |
| Body | String | The body of the request. |
## Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| Response Status Code | Number | The response status code. |
| Response Body | String | The body (i.e. the content) of the response. |
| Response Headers | String | The response headers. |
